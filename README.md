## App specifications
*Minimum*: Android 4.0.3

## Requirements
### Targeting Android
When developing an application for Android, you will also need to install:

- [Java JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (or higher)
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
    - We recommend using the "Android Studio".
    - *Linux*: The Android SDK requires 32 bit support libraries. On Ubuntu, get these via: 
    `apt-get install ia32-libs`
    - *Note*: On Windows, you need [vendor-specific device drivers](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html) 
    to connect to certain devices.
